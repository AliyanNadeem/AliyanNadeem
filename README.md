### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**AliyanNadeem/AliyanNadeem** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on nothing special in Github in particular, but maybe something mathematical which Github may or may not help in
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning A levels stuff, taking a break from higher level education and such
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on all sorts of ideas and projects really
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything I'll need help with, I'll have to navigate what that is
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my projects, skills and a few personal things if you want
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: my email is: aliyannadeem555@gmail.com 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He. atleast that's what I am
âš¡ Fun fact: i dont really got any, how about: gauss didn't discover, rather he rediscovered the divergence theorem, or: fruits can be viewed as more juicy vegetables
